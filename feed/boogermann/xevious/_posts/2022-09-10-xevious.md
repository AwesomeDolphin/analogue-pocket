Xevious (pronounced 'zeevious') is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots the heavily-armed 'Solvalou' combat ship and must destroy the evil Xevious forces trying to take over the planet. The Solvalou is equipped with two weapon systems; the forwards-firing "air zapper" for shooting air-based enemies and 'blaster bombs', for destroying ground-based enemies. To enable accurate targetting of the air-to-ground blaster bombs, a white and blue targeting indicator is situated in front of the Solvalou. This flashes when an enemy is in its sights.
